# Frontend Data

During this [Frontend Data](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-18-19/tree/master/frontend-data) course, I made an interactive datavisualization using D3 and the [OBA](https://www.oba.nl) [API](https://zoeken.oba.nl/api/v1/).

# Installation

```
npm install
```

# Research

During the previous course I already did some reasearch on the data in the API.
For this datavisualization I decided to compare all book genres throughout the years. If I have time left I also want to filter the genres by language.

So, for this datavisualization I need the following data from the API: `year` in which the book is published , `genre` of the book and `count` in genre.

I want the datavisualization look like this: ![sketch](img/sketch.png)
