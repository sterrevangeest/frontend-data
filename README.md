# Frontend Data

During this [Frontend Data](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-18-19/tree/master/frontend-data) course, I made an interactive datavisualization using D3 and the [OBA](https://www.oba.nl) [API](https://zoeken.oba.nl/api/v1/).

# Start

```
npm install
```

# Research

During the [previous course](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-18-19/tree/master/functional-programming) I already did some reasearch on the data in the API.
For this datavisualization I decided to some research on the **Biographies** in the OBA.

<!-- So, for this datavisualization I need the following data from the API: `year` in which the book is published , `genre` of the book and `count` in genre. -->

I want the datavisualization to look like this: ![sketch](img/wireframe.png)
